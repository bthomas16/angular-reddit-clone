# Angular Reddit Clone

It's time to put everything you've learned so far about Angular to use. You're going to make a reddit clone with posts, comments, searching, sorting, animations, and more! Watch the following video for an in-depth walk-through of the features.

Note:

* All post data should only be stored in a controller or service.
* A page refresh will clear all added posts.
* You do _not_ have to make any ajax requests or actually contact the reddit API.
